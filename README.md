## Abstract
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to capture high-quality multimedia data from the sky. With the rise of multimedia applications, such as aerial photography, cinematography, and mapping, UAVs have emerged as a powerful tool for gathering rich and diverse multimedia content. This workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts interested in UAV multimedia to explore the latest advancements, challenges, and opportunities in this exciting field. The workshop will cover various topics related to UAV multimedia, including aerial image and video processing, machine learning for UAV data analysis, UAV swarm technology, and UAV-based multimedia applications. In the context of the ACM Multimedia conference, this workshop is highly relevant as multimedia data from UAVs is becoming an increasingly important source of content for many multimedia applications. The workshop will provide a platform for researchers to share their work and discuss potential collaborations, as well as an opportunity for practitioners to learn about the latest developments in UAV multimedia technology.
Overall, this workshop will provide a unique opportunity to explore the exciting and rapidly evolving field of UAV multimedia and its potential impact on the wider multimedia community.

*  Video-based UAV Navigation
    + Satellite-guided & Ground-guided Navigation

## Submission Types

Paper can be submitted on [[Open Review]](https://openreview.net/group?id=acmmm.org/ACMMM/2023/Workshop/UAVs_in_Multimedia).

Submission template can be found at [ACM](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) or you may directly follow the [overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/yfpxtyngmzjn).

In this workshop, we welcome four types of submissions, all of which should relate to the topics and themes as listed in Section 3: 

- (1). Position or perspective papers (**up to 4 pages in length, plus unlimited pages for references**): original ideas, perspectives, research vision, and open challenges in the area of evaluation approaches for explainable recommender systems; 
- (2). Challenge papers (**up to 4 pages in length, plus unlimited pages for references**): original solution to the Challenge data, University160k, in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. 
- (3). Featured papers (title and abstract of the paper, plus the original paper): already published papers or papers summarizing existing publications in leading conferences and highimpact journals that are relevant for the topic of the workshop; 
- (4). Demonstration papers (**up to 2 pages in length, plus unlimited pages for references**): original or already published prototypes and operational evaluation approaches in the area of explainable recommender systems. Page limits include diagrams and appendices. Submissions should be single-blind, written in English, and formatted according to the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf templates are available from the ACM Website (use “sigconf” proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word).

**Tips:**
- For privacy protection, please blur faces in the published materials (such as paper, video, poster, etc.) 
- For social good, please do not contain any misleading words, such as ``surveillance`` and  ``secret``.


## Challenge

Challenge Platform is at https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/12672 . 

We also provide a challenging cross-view geo-localization dataset, called University160k, and the workshop audience may consider to participate the competition. The motivation is to simulate the real- world geo-localization scenario that we usually face an extremely large satellite-view pool. In particular, University160k extends the current University-1652 dataset with extra 167,486 satellite- view gallery distractors. We will release University160k on our website, and make a public leader board. These distractor satellite- view images have a size of 1024 × 1024 and are obtained by cutting orthophoto images of real urban and surrounding areas. The larger image size ensures higher image clarity, while the wider framing range allows the images to contain more diverse scenes, such as buildings, city roads, trees, fields, and more (see Figure 3). In our primary evaluation, the distractor is challenging and make the competitive baseline model, LPN, decrease the Recall@1 accuracy from 75.93% to 64.85% and the value of AP from 79.14% to 67.69% in the Drone → Satellite task (Please see Table 2). We hope more audiences can be involved to solve this challenge, and may also consider the efficiency problem against a large candidate pool.

Check challenge details at Section 5 in [https://zdzheng.xyz/files/ACMMM23_Workshop_Drone.pdf](https://zdzheng.xyz/files/ACMMM23_Workshop_Drone.pdf)

The challenge dataset contains two part.
1. The basic dataset (training set) can be download by [Request](https://github.com/layumi/University1652-Baseline/blob/master/Request.md). Usually I will reply the download link in 5 minutes. 

2. The name-masked test-160k dataset (query & gallery+distractor) can be downloaded from [Onedrive](https://hdueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/wongtyu_hdu_edu_cn/EhWkk5hLBfBPpknm0sSPDiAB_SJZdJaXqTU1zRp19APDYQ?e=ummz0M).

(In the future, you also can download the name-unmasked distractor dataset to quiclyt report number in your paper (Please add to satellite gallery) can be downloaded from [Onedrive](https://hdueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/wongtyu_hdu_edu_cn/EY4gu3JwWO9IkAp707N7wT0BkQOXFi-ZSDGnWkG9bad1_A?e=hodpkb), [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kYUBJazF0gqs2UQD46PvvJgnMVlJMPEs/view),
or Baidu Disk(https://pan.baidu.com/s/15TDqJIkEVv2r1fWlLQFLPw Code:78xf).)

The submission example can be found at [Baseline Submission](https://github.com/layumi/ACMMM2023Workshop/blob/main/answer.txt). Please zip it as ``answer.zip'' to submit the result.

Please return the top-10 satellite names. For example, the first query is ``Y2HVQvCQIwVmwzq.jpeg''. Therefore, the first line of returned result in ``answer.txt'' should be the format as follows:
```
LJMJGM5vTQM3iRy	ValP4k9neTZffLz	Co1CEWkBhHdTAM2	w2Nk6LrN5p2cF54	FuMp6XdwlRqScG2	4WVhVPBkr8TJTNJ	y7XiwY8lWpMZNar	AQZgRYUIyvpUnz8	bziEPp56rwI7e7E	qI9WAxrCnbaqjIq
```
Please return the result following the order of query at [Query TXT](https://github.com/layumi/ACMMM2023Workshop/blob/main/query_drone_name.txt)
It will be 37855 lines.
