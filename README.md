**Talk: Vehicle localization without SLAM: Finding your camera’s pose in an aerial image** ([Julian Kooi](https://jkooij.github.io/))
 
Abstract: Accurately locating a robotic vehicle with respect to a map is a key requirement for highly automated driving. While GNSS can provide precise positional information, it is often unreliable and inaccurate in urban environments where buildings block satellite reception (“urban canyons”). This talk discusses a vision-based alternative to determine the pose of a vehicle directly from its camera images. Ideally, such localization can improve the rough localization estimates from GNSS in a manner that accurately scales to large areas without the need for expensive Visual-SLAM. Instead, the emerging field of “fine-grained cross-view localization” develops methods that compare the vehicle’s camera images to easily obtained aerial imagery to estimate its location and viewing direction. I will discuss two deep learning techniques that we proposed for this task: Convolution Cross-View Pose Estimation (T-PAMI’23) and SliceMatch (CVPR’23). These supervised techniques rely on labelled training data, i.e. camera images with known highly accurate pose information, but this can be hard to obtain exactly because GNSS is often unreliable. Our most recent work aims to address this limitation by unsupervised adaptation of an already trained cross-view localization method to the images from a new area, only requiring that their location information is sufficient to pick the correct aerial image patch rather than defining the exact vehicle pose (ECCV’24).

**Talk： Causal AI: The Way of Change in the Age of AI** ([Qinfeng Shi](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~javen/))

Abstract：Our world is undergoing inevitable and tumultuous changes. Causality, operating beneath the veneer of cause and effect, is essentially the way of change. This talk will show how causal AI can identify the root causes, discover latent variables, build immunity against spurious correlations, improve generalisation to diverse domains and distribution shifts, model the consequence of interventions, and answer What-If counterfactual questions. More importantly, causal AI holds the key to answer the reverse question: What is the ideal sequence of interventions, given resources or budgets, to optimise future outcomes? Join us for an exploration of the transformative role of Causal AI in understanding and navigating the complexities of a rapidly changing world in the age of AI.

Bio： Professor Javen Qinfeng Shi is the Founding Director of Causal AI Group at the University of Adelaide, and one of the directors at Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML).

## Abstract
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to capture high-quality multimedia data from the sky. With the rise of multimedia applications, such as aerial photography, cinematography, and mapping, UAVs have emerged as a powerful tool for gathering rich and diverse multimedia content. This workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts interested in UAV multimedia to explore the latest advancements, challenges, and opportunities in this exciting field. The workshop will cover various topics related to UAV multimedia, including aerial image and video processing, machine learning for UAV data analysis, UAV swarm technology, and UAV-based multimedia applications. In the context of the ACM Multimedia conference, this workshop is highly relevant as multimedia data from UAVs is becoming an increasingly important source of content for many multimedia applications. The workshop will provide a platform for researchers to share their work and discuss potential collaborations, as well as an opportunity for practitioners to learn about the latest developments in UAV multimedia technology.
Overall, this workshop will provide a unique opportunity to explore the exciting and rapidly evolving field of UAV multimedia and its potential impact on the wider multimedia community.

## Challenge

Challenge Platform is at https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/12672 . 

We also provide a challenging cross-view geo-localization dataset, called University160k, and the workshop audience may consider to participate the competition. The motivation is to simulate the real- world geo-localization scenario that we usually face an extremely large satellite-view pool. In particular, University160k extends the current University-1652 dataset with extra 167,486 satellite- view gallery distractors. We will release University160k on our website, and make a public leader board. These distractor satellite- view images have a size of 1024 × 1024 and are obtained by cutting orthophoto images of real urban and surrounding areas. The larger image size ensures higher image clarity, while the wider framing range allows the images to contain more diverse scenes, such as buildings, city roads, trees, fields, and more (see Figure 3). In our primary evaluation, the distractor is challenging and make the competitive baseline model, LPN, decrease the Recall@1 accuracy from 75.93% to 64.85% and the value of AP from 79.14% to 67.69% in the Drone → Satellite task (Please see Table 2). We hope more audiences can be involved to solve this challenge, and may also consider the efficiency problem against a large candidate pool.
