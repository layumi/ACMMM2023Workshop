**Talk: Learning to Map Anything, Anywhere, Anytime** ([Nathan Jacobs](https://jacobsn.github.io/))
 
Abstract: What might it sound like here? How would you describe this place? Would it be unusual to see a large mammal if I took an early morning walk? These are all questions that are inherently spatial in nature and difficult to answer precisely. This talk explores a new approach to multi-modal remote sensing that shows how we might build a system that supports answering such questions at a global scale, enabling us to understand the Earth with a level of semantic, spatial, and temporal resolution that was previously impossible.

Bio：Nathan Jacobs earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis (2010). After many years at the University of Kentucky, he is currently a Professor in the Computer Science & Engineering department at Washington University in St. Louis. Dr. Jacobs' research area is computer vision; his specialty is developing learning-based algorithms and systems for processing large-scale image collections. His current focus is on developing techniques for mining information about people and the natural world from geotagged imagery, including images from social networks, publicly available outdoor webcams, and satellites. His research has been funded by NSF, NIH, DARPA, IARPA, NGA, ARL, AFRL, and Google.


**Talk：Semantically Guided Collaborative Navigation, 3D Mapping, Planning and Control for Unmanned Platforms** ([Rakesh Kumar](https://www.sri.com/about/people/rakesh-teddy-kumar))

Abstract：Classical metric navigation systems use GPS and/ or prior 2D and 3D maps for localization of unmanned platforms. However, these systems do not operate n in GPS challenged or denied environments. Metric map-based navigation systems are also not robust to dynamic scene changes. In this talk, we will describe various methods we have developed to incorporate AI derived semantic information into metric navigation for both ground and aerial robots using data from multiple sensors. Compared to low-level metric features, semantic information is more robust to scene changes over time and can be matched across time/space/platforms. We will also discuss how 3D reference semantic maps can be built.
Sharing semantic information also reduces bandwidth required for collaboration. Moreover, it enables natural language interaction between humans and mobile platforms. Finally, we will discuss how the semantic information can be used by robots to learn to navigate in unmapped areas much like humans are able to visit and navigate in new, never visited before locales. Our new approach, SayNav, leverages common-sense knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient generalization to complicated navigation tasks in unknown large-scale environments.

Bio：Rakesh “Teddy” Kumar, Ph.D., is Vice President, Information and Computing Sciences and Director of the Center for Vision Technologies at SRI International. In this role, he is responsible for leading research and development of innovative end-to-end vision solutions from image capture to situational understanding that translate into real-world applications such as robotics, intelligence extraction and human computer interaction. He has received the Outstanding Achievement in Technology Development award from his alma mater, University of Massachusetts Amherst, the Sarnoff Presidents Award, and Sarnoff Technical Achievement awards for his work in registration of multi-sensor, multi-dimensional medical images and alignment of video to three-dimensional scene models. The paper “Stable Vision-Aided Navigation for Large-Area Augmented Reality” co-authored by him received the best paper award in the IEEE Virtual Reality 2011 conference. The paper “Augmented Reality Binoculars” co-authored by him received the best paper award in the IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR) 2013 conference. 
Kumar has served on NSF review and DARPA ISAT panels. He has also been an associate editor for IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence. He has co-authored more than 60 research publications, and received more than 50 patents. A number of spin-off companies have been created based on the research done at the Center for Vision Technologies. Kumar received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in 1992. His M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering is from State University of New York at Buffalo in 1995, and his B.Tech in Electrical Engineering is from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India in 1983.

## Abstract
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to capture high-quality multimedia data from the sky. With the rise of multimedia applications, such as aerial photography, cinematography, and mapping, UAVs have emerged as a powerful tool for gathering rich and diverse multimedia content. This workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts interested in UAV multimedia to explore the latest advancements, challenges, and opportunities in this exciting field. The workshop will cover various topics related to UAV multimedia, including aerial image and video processing, machine learning for UAV data analysis, UAV swarm technology, and UAV-based multimedia applications. In the context of the ACM Multimedia conference, this workshop is highly relevant as multimedia data from UAVs is becoming an increasingly important source of content for many multimedia applications. The workshop will provide a platform for researchers to share their work and discuss potential collaborations, as well as an opportunity for practitioners to learn about the latest developments in UAV multimedia technology.
Overall, this workshop will provide a unique opportunity to explore the exciting and rapidly evolving field of UAV multimedia and its potential impact on the wider multimedia community.

## Challenge

Challenge Platform is at https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/12672 . 

We also provide a challenging cross-view geo-localization dataset, called University160k, and the workshop audience may consider to participate the competition. The motivation is to simulate the real- world geo-localization scenario that we usually face an extremely large satellite-view pool. In particular, University160k extends the current University-1652 dataset with extra 167,486 satellite- view gallery distractors. We will release University160k on our website, and make a public leader board. These distractor satellite- view images have a size of 1024 × 1024 and are obtained by cutting orthophoto images of real urban and surrounding areas. The larger image size ensures higher image clarity, while the wider framing range allows the images to contain more diverse scenes, such as buildings, city roads, trees, fields, and more (see Figure 3). In our primary evaluation, the distractor is challenging and make the competitive baseline model, LPN, decrease the Recall@1 accuracy from 75.93% to 64.85% and the value of AP from 79.14% to 67.69% in the Drone → Satellite task (Please see Table 2). We hope more audiences can be involved to solve this challenge, and may also consider the efficiency problem against a large candidate pool.
